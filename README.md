# Spell Pack Template
Template repository for Electroblob's Wizardry (1.12.2) spell packs

## Setting up the development environment
#### 1) Install JDK jdk1.8.0_181
For windows, this is jre-8u181-windows-x64.exe, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html)
#### 2) Update the template with your own data
This involves a couple of steps:
- Update gradle.properties with your own information
- Update any mentions of the mod's name, author name, curseforge link, modid, etc
- I recommend using IntelliJ as an IDE. You can run the game with the `runClient` task
